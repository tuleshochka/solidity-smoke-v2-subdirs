      description: solc frequently releases new compiler versions. Using an old version prevents access to new Solidity security checks. We also recommend avoiding complex pragma statement.
      recommendation: Deploy with a recent version of Solidity (at least 0.8.29) with no known severe issues. Use a simple pragma version that allows any of these versions. Consider using the latest version of Solidity for testing.
